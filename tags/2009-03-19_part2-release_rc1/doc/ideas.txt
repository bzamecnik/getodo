- Task & persistence
	- Problems:
		- Sometimes we need to access TaskManager from Task or TaskPersistence
		- There are two interfaces to Task: Task, TaskPersistence
	- Posible solutions:
		- TaskPersisence would contain a reference to TaskManager (instead of
			just a database conneciton)
		- Join Task and TaskPersistence
			- everything would go to Task
			- it would be easier to use
			- what about copying?
	- the same holds for Tag and FilterRule

- Fuzzy dates
	- due date could have a "leading time", ie. a period in which it
		starts to appear

- computed priority
