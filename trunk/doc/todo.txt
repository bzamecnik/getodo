===== GeToDo TODO =====

- **Prepare for pilot version!**
	- complete designing GUI in Glade
		- editing panel (remake it), menu, toolbar...
	- bind GUI actions to libgetodo calls  
	- make an installer from release build

- Task (database)
	- add bool done field (to SQL, field, access methods, serialization)
	- rename: description -> title, longDescription -> description
- TaskPersistence, FilterRulePersistence - split save() into insert() and update()
- use operator= for copying Tasks and Tags
- use operator<< and operator>> for I/O of objects like DateTime, Tag, ...  
- Recurrence
	- next() for RecurrenceWeekly, RecurrenceMonthly
	- use facet for RecurrenceIntervalDays and possibly RecurrenceYearly
- write custom TreeModel for FilerRule
- DateTime, Date
	- discard static toString() and move the code into the non-static toString()
	- output special date values as ""
- delete operator
	- don't check if the deleted pointer isn't NULL, it's redundant
	- exception: don't delete what was never allocated (and had been initialized to NULL) 
- TaskManager
	- write filtering code
	- add some new methods (see source code comments)
	*- getPersistentTask() should not return TaskPersistence by reference but by value
	- public methods shouldn't return pointers!
- use exceptions!
- avoid duplicating code!!!
- save sqlite table names somewhere as constants
- documenation
	- we need: user docs, programmer's guide
	- use Doxygen and write better doxygen comments
	- write a README and INSTALL
	- write a paper on overall architecture and design notes
	- write file description into each file's header
- write the rest of testing code to test the libgetodo
	- [Duration, ...]

==== Think of ====

- TaskPersistence/TaskManager how to use individual property setters?
	- should persistence set* also call set* in its managed task?
- Task - think of priority:
	- explicitly set
	- computed from other things
- Duration, FuzzyDate
- FilterRule - think of format and function
- think of a common interface to persistent objects (Task, Tag, FilterRule)
- think whether really use pointers to Task, Tag, ...
- *Persistence - make a common interface
- Task - make simple properties public and remove their getters/setters (really?)
- database triggers for checking date format validity
- How to embed .glade file into the final .exe file? (Is it really needed?)

==== BUGS ====

- strange crashes in testing module
	- unhandled exceptions when writing somewhere usually in destructors of
		a basic_stringstream or so
	- from revision 44 on
	- sometime works OK when sqlite3x optimization is /O2 (Maximize Speed)
		- when optimiztion is disabled it crashes
	- happens in conjuction of DateTime (stringstream operations) and sqlite3x 

==== Done - kept for reference ====

* use boost::lexical_cast instead of stringstream for simple type conversions
* run autoreconf --install (only once)
* set LD_CONFIG_... for running main executable (for .so libraries)
- write some testing code to test the libgetodo
	*-	TaskManager

	* FilterRule, FilterRulePersistence
	* Task, TaskPersistence
	* Date, DateTime
	* Recurrence, RecurrenceDaily, RecurrenceWeekly, RecurrenceMonthly,
