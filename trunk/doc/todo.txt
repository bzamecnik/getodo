===== GeToDo TODO =====

- write some testing code to test the libgetodo
	* Tag, TagPersistence
	* FilterRule, FilterRulePersistence
	- Task, TaskPersistence
	-	TaskManager
	* Date, DateTime
	- [Recurrence, Duration, ...]		
- think of an API between lib and GUI
- design GUI
	- in Glade
	- Glade will generate a XML that will be dynamically loaded into the program
	- http://www.gtkmm.org/docs/gtkmm-2.4/docs/tutorial/html/sec-libglademm-loading-glade-file.html

- TaskManager - filtering
- TaskPersistence
	- addTag(), addSubtask() - check if the task and the tag exist in the db
- use boost::lexical_cast instead of stringstream for simple type conversions
- Recurrence, Duration, FuzzyDate - think of
- Recurrence
	- conversion from/to string
- FilterRule - think of format and function
- Task - think of priority:
	- explicitly set
	- computed from other things
- exceptions
- avoid duplicating code!!!
- save sqlite table names somewhere as constants
- database triggers for checking date format validity

== Done - kept for reference ==

* run autoreconf --install (only once)
* set LD_CONFIG_... for running main executable (for .so libraries)
