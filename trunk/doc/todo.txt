===== GeToDo TODO =====

- write some testing code to test the libgetodo
	* Tag, TagPersistence
	* FilterRule, FilterRulePersistence
	- Task - test new recurrence methods
	- TaskPersistence!
	-	TaskManager!
	* Date, DateTime
	* Recurrence, RecurrenceDaily, RecurrenceWeekly, RecurrenceMonthly,
		RecurrenceYearly, RecurrenceIntervalDays
	- [Duration, ...]		
- write custom TreeModel for Task and FilerRule 
*- think of an API between lib and GUI
- design GUI
	- in Glade
	- Glade will generate a XML that will be dynamically loaded into the program
	- http://www.gtkmm.org/docs/gtkmm-2.4/docs/tutorial/html/sec-libglademm-loading-glade-file.html
	- Question: how to embed .glade file into the final .exe file?
	  - Is it needed?

- Task - add bool done field (to SQL, field, access methods, serialization)
- Recurrence
	- next() for RecurrenceWeekly, RecurrenceMonthly
	- use facet for RecurrenceIntervalDays and possibly RecurrenceYearly
- Task - make simple properties public and remove their getters/setters
- *Persistence - make a common interface
- use operator= for copying Tasks and Tags  
- DateTime, Date
	- discard static toString() and move the code to the non-static method
	- output special date values as ""
- FilterRule - think of format and function
- Task - think of priority:
	- explicitly set
	- computed from other things
- TaskManager - filtering
- Duration, FuzzyDate - think of
- exceptions
- avoid duplicating code!!!
- save sqlite table names somewhere as constants
- database triggers for checking date format validity

== Done - kept for reference ==

* use boost::lexical_cast instead of stringstream for simple type conversions
* run autoreconf --install (only once)
* set LD_CONFIG_... for running main executable (for .so libraries)
