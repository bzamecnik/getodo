===== GeToDo TODO =====

====  Long term goals ====

- prepare final Year Project release (2008/11-12)
- extend the Year Project to the Bachelor Thesis
	- specify the subject and register it (until 14.11.2008)
	- implement (summer 2009)

==== Tasks ====

- Task (database)
	- rename: description -> title, longDescription -> description
- SQL autoincrement - don't repeat what sqlite already set
- use shared_ptr in TaskManager for holding pointers to Tasks, Tags, ...
- use exceptions!
- doxygen docs - try it, make it working
- TaskPersistence, FilterRulePersistence - split save() into insert() and update()
- use operator= for copying Tasks and Tags

- improve GUI design in Glade
	- editing panel, menu, toolbar...	
	- 	
	*- tag list editing
	- selecting a db file	
*- bind GUI actions to libgetodo calls  

- recurrence editing dialog
	- fix: make sensitive only controls for selected recurrence type,
		make others insensitive
- write custom TreeModel for FilerRule
- Recurrence
	- next() for RecurrenceWeekly, RecurrenceMonthly
	- use facet for RecurrenceIntervalDays and RecurrenceYearly (?)
- delete operator
	- don't check if the deleted pointer isn't NULL, it's redundant
	- exception: don't delete what was never allocated (and had been initialized to NULL) 
- TaskManager
	- write filtering code
	- add some new methods (see source code comments)
	*- getPersistentTask() should not return TaskPersistence by reference but by value
	- public methods shouldn't return pointers! - see shared_ptr
- TreeViews should be sortable (see bugs)
- avoid duplicating code!!!
- save sqlite table names somewhere as constants
- documenation
	- we need: user docs, programmer's guide
	- use Doxygen and write better doxygen comments
	- write a README and INSTALL
	- write a paper on overall architecture and design notes
	- write file description into each file's header
- write the rest of testing code to test the libgetodo
	- [Duration, ...]
- use Boost Test facilities for the testing code
- use SQL transactions
- apply advices from book Sutter, Alexandrescu: C++ 101 Programming Techniques

==== Think of ====

*- use a kind of bug tracking system
	*- Flyspray - easier to install
	- Bugzilla (http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/win32install.html)
		- would be more interesting to try
	- Trac
- GTD
	- apply GTD stuff on top of GeToDo facilities
	- read the GTD book
- TaskPersistence/TaskManager how to use individual property setters?
	- should persistence set* also call set* in its managed task?
- Task - think of priority:
	- explicitly set
	- computed from other things
- Duration, FuzzyDate
- FilterRule - think of format and function
- think of a common interface to persistent objects (Task, Tag, FilterRule)
*- think whether really use pointers to Task, Tag, ... NO -> use shared_ptr
- *Persistence - make a common interface
- Task - make simple properties public and remove their getters/setters (really?)
- database triggers for checking date format validity
- How to embed .glade file into the final .exe file? (Is it really needed?)
- maybe make Task, Tag etc. "data classes" and store them by value 
- use secondary index containers for reverse lookup of maps (Tasks, Tags, ...)
	- eg.:
		- map<id_t, shared_ptr<Tag>> indexed by id_t
		- map<std::string, map<id_t, shared_ptr<Tag>>::iterator> indexed by tag name
- database
	- use autoincrement fields
	- think of tree structure of tasks
- use several types of tags
	- normal tags (used as categories)
	- status
	- context (?)
- better installer

==== BUGS ====

- strange crashes in testing module
	- unhandled exceptions when writing somewhere usually in destructors of
		a basic_stringstream or so
	- from revision 44 on
	- sometime works OK when sqlite3x optimization is /O2 (Maximize Speed)
		- when optimiztion is disabled it crashes
	- happens in conjuction of DateTime (stringstream operations) and sqlite3x
- TreeModelSort doesn't work well with my custom TreeModels
	- error message: "(getodogui.exe:2596): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_tree_model_sort_build_level: assertion `length > 0' failed"
	- TaskTreeView is empty

==== Done - kept for reference ====

* use boost::lexical_cast instead of stringstream for simple type conversions
* run autoreconf --install (only once)
* set LD_CONFIG_... for running main executable (for .so libraries)
- write some testing code to test the libgetodo
	*-	TaskManager
	* TaskPersistence
	* Tag, TagPersistence
	* FilterRule, FilterRulePersistence
	* Task, TaskPersistence
	* Date, DateTime
	* Recurrence, RecurrenceDaily, RecurrenceWeekly, RecurrenceMonthly,
		RecurrenceYearly, RecurrenceIntervalDays
